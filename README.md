- my first platform game ;-;

- I have added two levels, a starting screen, and an ending screen to the game, which is a Mario-like platform game. I chose strawberries as collectible items, and there are also some traps such as saws and spikes. If the player touches these traps, the game restarts.

- I made various adjustments to the player movement script and learned and implemented several features for jumping, walking, and moving with the walking platform. Additionally, I explored and applied sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.

- I consider these developments a good start for my first fully completed game.

- Heres only my scripts i upload... My fault sorry!
